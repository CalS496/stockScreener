Learning about Stocks
	*Shares vs regular stocks (the differences in their
	commodities)

*Only going into basics, way for firms to get money to invest 
in capital

No shorting stocks - sell stocks at higher because you expected
lower

**Look more on stocks that we think are profitable for now

///////////////////////////////
Three different graphs: How they perform and function

For everything, use SMP500 as a basis

SMP500: Index that tracks the 500 biggest companies (in the USA)
and NASDQ

Use 2 different 
Slow Moving Average: Compares with the SMP500, curve should
be over to indicate that SMP500 is doing well

The Volume : Over 250,000, the greater the volume, the more stable
(More investors, not as easily swayed)

(MACD) Moving Average Convergence Divergence : Showing
the short term momentum of the stocks
Just average of the day

Stochastic Fast: Shows increments in time (slow or fast choice)
shows if stock is oversold / overbought
	Oversold: Lots of people sell
	Overbought: Lots of people buy
