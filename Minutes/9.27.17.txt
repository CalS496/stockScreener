Reviewing Individual Research 10-15
Michelle:
	SMA - Simple Moving Average: Trends and averages
		To calculate: Take average of closing prices, 
		for however, 30 day for us, compare it against SMP500

		All points are equal in a SMA

		*Lines are stock prices,
		"A good indicator is when it is on an upward trend
		and is above average"

	Volume - Looking at average volume (for us) for 30 days
		MIN: $250,000
		Trade: Buy and Sell at the same price
		Number of shares traded for a given period
		
		*Basically gives concrete measure of investor interest
		and trends in demands

	Sectors - From top down, largest one is sector (group 
		of companies),
		Next is industry
		Finally is stock
		Few that we will look at! Always google later

Calvin: 
Stochastic Fast
	Is there a limited amount of stocks being traded?
	 -Comparing to the volume being traded before,
		Not really a fixed number?

Teo: 
MACD - Moving Average Convergence Divergence
	Short term momentum, positive and negative
	Positive: from barish to bullish
	Negative: from bullish to barish

	barish: falling share prices
	bullish: rising share prices


*Like looking at stocks with a bar chart
	Suggestion: it is easier, left is close, right is open

////////////////////////////
API
	Observations
	Consistent arguments / kwarguments

Wireframes
	Challenge: Do we have to draw the graphs or can we
	import them

	Maybe in the API?

	How can we get all the variables?
		From NYSCE or NASDAQ
		Whichever one, do research first

	Watchlist page: stores all the generated graphs here
		symbol
		last price
		net change
		last updated

	**Keep interactivity for later (AVOID SCOPE CREEP)

	***Keep HTML&CSS 

	Possibly create an equation that can help with determining 
	importance. > Gives a priority watch list

	Able to create in ascending order importance of generated
	graphs

	How can we have persistent memory? Store once, or just send us
	once.
	
	Also show netchange for the day? Flags for sudden changes? (Hard
	to do cause market is volatile - saved for later)

**Assume barebones!!!!
-No interactivity
-No multiple users

////////////////////////////	
HW:
	Look into kwargs vs args (10 sec search!)
	Self-Review: Python, Json

Next Meeting: 
	Plan A: Sun Oct 1 (save 2 or more hours)
	11-1
	Sit down and figure out the code/API actually running
	Print results
	WONT LEAVE UNTIL WE GET SOMETHING
